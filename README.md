Throttling service
==================
Implementation of rate limiter service that limits allowed requests per second
(RPS) for each user to provide Service Layer Agreement (SLA).
For `N` users, `K` rsp during `T` seconds around `T*N*K` requests are expected to be successful.

Rules for RPS counting
----------------------
1. If no token provided, assume the client as unauthorized.
2. All unauthorized user's requests are limited by `graceRps`
3. If request has a token, but slaService has not returned any info yet,
treat it as unauthorized user
4. RPS should be counted per user, as the same user might use
different tokens for authorization
5. SLA should be counted by intervals of 1/10 second (i.e. if RPS
limit is reached, after 1/10 second ThrottlingService should allow
10% more requests)
6. SLA information is changed quite rarely and SlaService is quite
costly to call (~250ms per request), so consider caching SLA
requests. Also, you should not query the service, if the same token
request is already in progress.
7. Consider that REST service average response time is bellow 5ms,
ThrottlingService shouldnâ€™t impact REST service SLA.
